#  My First ASP.NET Project

This is my **first project built with ASP.NET**, and also my **first project written entirely in English**.  
It’s based on the example from the book *"The Little ASP.NET Book"*.

The purpose of this project is to learn the fundamentals of **ASP.NET web development**, including:
- Building and running a basic web application 🧩  
- Understanding server-side rendering 🖥️  
- Exploring how ASP.NET handles requests and responses 🌐
